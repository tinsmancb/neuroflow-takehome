    "The prompt stated that users of the app are given a notification to rate their sleep and mood at 8 AM every day. When we plot a histogram of the distriubtion of times during the day when reports are made, there are two large spikes: one at 12:00 UTC and one at 13:00 UTC. The eastern time zone is 5 hours behind UTC normally and 4 hours behind during daylight savings time. These spikes being 4 and 5 hours ahead of 8 AM UTC respectively, we can intuit that the times might all be eastern time. Indeed, when we convert the dates to the eastern time zone, we see the two spikes collapse onto one at 8 AM, the time when the users are prompted for reports. From this data, we can see that by far most reports are made at 8 AM or before 12 noon, and then tail off gradually into the afternoon, evening and night."

The number of reports made of each type is shown as well, in order to give some idea of how well the patient is keeping up with the exercies. The function takes a user id as well as a list of analytics to plot.

Sleep and Mood appear to be more or less normally distributed, while the stress metrics have a more asymmetrical distribution. This may just be a consequence of the fact that there are many more sleep and mood reports in the dataset than stress reports. There are also not a lot of correlation present between the metrics themselves, it would make sense to me for users with higher quality sleep to have better mood, for example. There is more variation overall in the stress metrics than in the other two, but this can once again be attributed to the number of reports of each type."

I would expect that overall, the metrics should correlate somewhat with each other (better sleep should correlate with better mood, etc) but this does not appear to be the case. Even more puzzling, reports of sleep during the middle of the night are no worse than those in the morning, which would seem strange unless many of the users worked the night shift. As far as other peices of information that might be useful, other metrics from the user such as pain, other forms of stress, or fatigue could be useful. Information about the amount of time spent sleeping would complement the subjective rating of sleep quality. Finally, evaluations from the user's therapist/psychologist/other healthcare provider would be a good complement to the subjective ratings from the user, particularly when evaluating overall progress."
